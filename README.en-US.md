# MLN
MLN is a mobile cross-platform development framework that allows developers to build Android and iOS applications with a set of code. MLN design ideas are close to native development. The experience of client developers can be quickly migrated to MLN to easily build cross-platform mobile applications.

* Designed for client developers.

* Increase the package body size, 1.2M.

* True native performance. Cross-platform often means impaired performance. Thanks to the high performance of the Lua virtual machine and MLN optimization, we greatly reduce the impact of intermediate media, and load pages quickly even on low-end Android phones.

* Support hot update.

## Development Environment
* IntelliJ IDEA: MLN recommends using IDEA for development. After IDEA installs the plugin, you can use hot reload to preview the page.
  [Configuration Guide](https://github.com/momotech/MLN/wiki/MLN-development-environment)
* Android Studio (3.5 is recommended): [Download](https://developer.android.com/studio/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIoceaiI-q5gIVwWkqCh3nmAMREAAYASAAEgLoYfD_BwE)
* Xcode: Search and download in App Store

## Application of MLN in Momo
Momo's homepage, live frames, some more frames, nearby groups, werewolf circles and other functions are all developed with MLN. For more than a year, the stability and performance of MLN has withstood the test of Momo's billion-dollar MAU.
